# NSGAII4ID-algorithm

this algorithm is a new proposed algorithm in privacy preserving data mining for hiding sensitive frequent itemset from database, we use NSGA-II algorithm in order to find the optimal set of transaction to be modified by removing some items.
main.m is the principal file to run the codof NSGAII4ID. the code is programming in matlab.
